<h1> Anime World</h1>
<p>Origin: Anime is a Japanese term derived from the English word "animation." It refers to animated works, whether they are TV series, films, or web series, produced in Japan or by Japanese creators. Anime can be hand-drawn or created using computer-generated imagery (CGI).

    Diversity of Genres: Anime covers a vast array of genres, including action, adventure, romance, science fiction, fantasy, horror, comedy, drama, and more. This diversity allows it to appeal to a broad audience.
    
    Manga Adaptations: Many anime series and films are adaptations of manga, which are Japanese comic books or graphic novels. These adaptations often stay faithful to the source material, but they can also diverge in various ways.</p>
